## Background Problems
A supermarket owner named Andi has plans to improve his business by creating a self-service cashier system. The system allows customers to input the items purchased, the number of items, the price of the items, and other features. So, Andi needs a programmer to create the cashier system.

---

## Objectives
This project aims to create a self-service cashier system with the following flow :

The customers create a customer transaction ID.
Customers input the name of the item, quantity of items, and price of the item purchased.
If it turns out there was an error in entering the item name, item quantity, or item price, the customer can change or update the item :
update the item name
update the number of items
update the item price
If the customers cancel to purchase an item, customers can delete the item:
delete 1 item
reset all transactions
If the customers have finished purchasing, but are still unsure whether the price of the goods and name entered are correct, the customers can check the order with the following output:
Issue the message "Order is correct" if there are no input errors.
Issue the message "There is a data input error" if an input error occurs.
Displays a table containing all order data.
Finally, customers can display the total price or total purchase to be paid and the discount obtained (if any).
